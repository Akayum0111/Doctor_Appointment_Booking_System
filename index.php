				<p class="text-justify">OVDAS is available for everyone 24 hours in a day. It allows you to focus on the most important aspect of your business — caring for the animals that need your help. 
							Digital veterinary appointment scheduling systems help to balance out the day for both veterinarians and their clients. These technology solutions allow clients to easily book an appointment in advance. Online scheduling reduces the administrative burden on office support staff — and the stress on everyone in the clinic.
							Clients prefer online scheduling because they can see options for appointment times, and it can reduce their wait times. If your veterinary clinic doesn’t already have a streamlined solution for appointment scheduling, then it’s time to upgrade your workflow to better serve your customers. </p>
